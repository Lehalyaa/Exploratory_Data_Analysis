## Theory

### 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language. It is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing due to its simplicity and readability.

### 2. What is Anaconda?
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a free, open-source distribution of Python and R designed specifically for data science and machine learning tasks.

**Advantages of Anaconda:**
* Comes pre-installed with Python, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
* Simplifies package and environment management.
* Avoids complex dependency issues.
* Suitable for both beginners and professionals.

### 3. Why Python?
* **Simple and Easy to Learn:** Python has a clean syntax that mimics natural English.
* **Versatile:** Used in Web Development, Data Science, AI, Scripting, and more.
* **Large Community:** Massive support through forums like StackOverflow.
* **Rich Libraries:** Extensive libraries for almost any task (e.g., Pandas for data, TensorFlow for AI).

### 4. Why Jupyter Notebook?
* **Interactive Coding:** Code can be run cell-by-cell, making debugging easier.
* **Rich Media Support:** Supports equations (LaTeX), visualizations, and narrative text alongside code.
* **Data Visualization:** Ideal for plotting graphs and analyzing data instantly.

## Google Colab

**Google Colab** (Colaboratory) is a cloud-based Python environment provided by Google. It functions similarly to Jupyter Notebook but runs entirely in the cloud.

### Advantages
*  **No installation required** (runs in browser).
*  **Free GPU/TPU access** for training machine learning models.
*  **Easy collaboration** (share links like Google Docs).

### How to Use
1.  Visit [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2.  Sign in using your Google account.
3.  Click **New Notebook** to start coding.
