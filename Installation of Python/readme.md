# Experiment - 1 - Installation of Python

### Aim:
To study the basics of Python programming language, understand the Python execution environment, install Python and Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda distribution, and explore various Python IDEs including Google Colab.

### Objectives:
* To understand Python features and applications

* To install Python and Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda

* To explore Python IDEs and environments

* To execute basic Python programs using Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab

### Theory:
**1. Introduction to Python:**

Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simple syntax and versatility. It is the leading language for:

Data Science & AI: Powering libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.

Automation: Scripting repetitive tasks efficiently.

**2. The Anaconda Ecosystem:**

Anaconda is the world's most popular data science platform. It simplifies package management and deployment.

**Why Python?**

* **Readability:** Syntax resembles English, making it beginner-friendly.

* **Interpreted:** Code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging.

* **Extensive Libraries:** Over 300,000+ packages available for nearly any task.

**Why Jupyter Notebook?**

* **Interactivity:** Allows you to run code in "cells" and see results immediately.

* **Documentation:** Supports Markdown for combining code, images, and text in one document.

* **EDA:** Ideally suited for Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization.

**Installation & Setup:**

* **Local Installation (Anaconda)Download:** Go to Anaconda.com and download the installer for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

* **Install:** Run the executable and follow the setup wizard (it is recommended to add Anaconda to your PATH).

* **Launch:** Open the Anaconda Navigator and click Launch under Jupyter Notebook.

### Steps to use Google Colab:
* Visit https://colab.research.google.com

* Sign in using Google account

* Create a new Python notebook

### Advantages:
* No installation required

* Free GPU/TPU access

* Easy collaboration

* Runs in browser

### Conclusion:
Python provides a flexible and powerful programming environment. Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab simplify learning and exploratory data analysis by providing interactive execution and visualization support. convert this file into a readme file for github repository
